        <h1>Eric Van Horn</h1>
        <p>I’m a student at East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania, majoring in Digital Media Technologies with a concentration in Graphic & Web Design. While my main focus is on graphic and web design, I’ve had the chance to explore many aspects of media production, including video, photography, sound recording, and more. I consider myself to be proficient in all aspects of media production, with a broad skill set that allows me to tackle a wide range of projects.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Whether I’m designing a website or shooting a video, I’m motivated by bringing an idea to life and making it the best it can be. I don’t believe in settling for "good enough." I’m flexible in my approach and often find that the best ideas come to me as I go, rather than following a rigid plan.</p>

        <br>
        <p>While I’m still building my portfolio, most of the work you’ll see on this site comes from class projects. These projects have allowed me to develop a variety of skills and experiment with different media. I’m always looking for opportunities to learn and grow, and I’m excited to continue expanding my skill set.</p>

        For this project, I created a mockup for a fictional clothing brand from scratch, complete with a logo, product mockups, and a fully coded website. I built the site using HTML and CSS, and while I don’t know JavaScript myself, I experimented with some AI-generated code to add some interactivity. The website is a work in progress, as I often use it as a sandbox to test new skills I have learned. I started creating this when I was just beginning to learn and experiment with web design, and through the process I gained a stronger understanding of how branding, design, and development can come together in a single project.

    <h2>Ai In Media</h2>
    <div class="about" id="ai">
    <p>I often incorporate AI tools into my workflow. Whether I’m brainstorming ideas and concepts or I'm stuck on something, AI acts as a sounding board, much like bouncing ideas off another person. If I have a rough concept or need fresh perspectives, I input it into AI and see where it takes me. This helps me visualize ideas quickly, especially for designs or images, allowing me to explore what a concept could look like before dedicating hours to actually creating it. I also use AI to troubleshoot or learn new techniques, such as getting quick tips on how to perform specific tasks or a to get a snippet of code. It helps me push my boundaries and fill in the gaps where I’m still learning or experimenting, making my work more efficient and improved.</p>
